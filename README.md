# **Delance - Decentralized Freelance Platform for Students** 🚀

## 🏆 **Inspiration**
Many students with **amateur skills** struggle to enter the freelancing market due to **high competition and platform fees** on Web2 platforms like Fiverr and Upwork.  
At the same time, many clients need **small-scale tasks** done but find **expert freelancers too expensive**.

**Delance** solves this by providing a **trustless, low-cost, decentralized** freelancing platform where:
- 🎓 **Students** can find work suited to their skill level without high platform commissions.
- 💼 **Clients** can hire affordable freelancers for small-scale tasks.
